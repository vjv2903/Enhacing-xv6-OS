# Enhacing-xv6-OS
Added syscall and some scheduling algorithms
## Waitx Sys Call
As a part of this task, you're expected to extend the current proc structure and add
new fields ctime, etime and rtime for creation time, end-time and total time
respectively of a process. When a new process gets created the kernel code should
update the process creation time. The run-time should get updated after every clock
tick for the process. To extract this information from the kernel add a new system call
which extends wait. The new call will be:

int waitx(int* wtime, int* rtime)

The two arguments are pointers to integers to which waitx will assign the total
number of clock ticks during which process was waiting and total number of clock
ticks when the process was running. The return values for waitx should be same as
that of wait system-call. Create a test program which utilizes the waitx system call by
creating a ‘time’ like command for the same.
Note: This can be used to implement your scheduler functions.
## Getpinfo Sys Call
You'll need to create a new system call for this part: ​ int getpinfo(struct proc_stat
*)​ . This routine returns some basic information about each process: its process ID,
total run time, how many times it has been chosen to run, which queue it is currently
on 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 (check Task 2 part c) and ticks received in each queue. To do this,
you will need to create the ​ proc_stat​ struct :-

struct proc_stat {
int pid; // PID of each process
float runtime; // Use suitable unit of time
int num_run; // number of time the process is executed
int current_queue; // current assigned queue
int ticks[5]; // number of ticks each process has received at each of the 5 priority
queue
};

## Schedulers 
The default scheduler of xv6 is a round-robin based scheduler. In this task, you’ll
implement 3 other scheduling policies and incorporate them in Xv6.
### (a) First come - First Served (FCFS)
Implement a non preemptive ​ policy that selects the process with the lowest creation
time. The process runs until it no longer needs CPU time.
### (b) Priority Based Scheduler
A priority-based scheduler selects the process with the highest priority for execution.
In case two or more processes have the same priority, we choose them in a
round-robin fashion. The priority of a process can be in the range [0,100], the smaller
value will represent higher priority. Set the default priority of a process as 60. To
change the default priority add a new system call ​ set_priority​ which can change the
priority of a process.
int set_priority(int)
The system-call returns the old-priority value of the process. In case the priority of
the process increases (the value is lower than before), then rescheduling should be
done.
### (c) Multi-level Feedback queue scheduling
MLFQ scheduler allows processes to move between different priority queues based
on their behavior and CPU bursts. If a process uses too much CPU time, it is pushed
to a lower priority queue, leaving I/O bound and interactive processes for higher
priority queues. Also, to prevent starvation, it implements aging.
Keeping all these benefits in mind, implement a simplified multi-level feedback
queue scheduler.
#### Scheduler Details :-
  1. Create five priority queues, with the highest priority being number as 0 and
  bottom queue with the lowest priority as 4.
  2. Assign a suitable value for 1 tick of CPU timer.3. The time-slice for priority 0 should be 1 timer tick. The times-slice   for priority 1
  is 2 timer ticks; for priority 2, it is 4 timer ticks; for priority 3, it is 8 timer ticks;
  for priority 4, it is 16 timer ticks.
#### Procedure :-
  1. On the initiation of a process, push it to the end of the highest priority queue.
  2. The highest priority queue should be run always, if not empty.
  3. If the process completes, it leaves the system.
  4. If the process used the complete time slice assigned for its current priority
  queue, it is pre-empted and ​ inserted at the end of the next lower level queue.
  5. If a process voluntarily relinquishes control of the CPU, it leaves the queuing
  network, and when the process becomes ready again after the I/O, it is
  inserted at the tail of the same queue, from which it is relinquished earlier
  6. A round-robin scheduler should be used for processes at the lowest priority
  queue.
  7. To prevent starvation, implement the aging phenomenon using the structure
  defined in Task - 1 :-
    a. If the wait time of a process in lower priority queues exceeds a given
    limit(assign a suitable limit to prevent starvation), their priority is
    increased and they are pushed to the next higher priority queue.
    b. The wait time is defined as the difference between the current time and
    the time at which the process was last executed.
    Modify the Makefile ​ to support SCHEDULER - a macro for compilation of the
    specified scheduling algorithm. Use the flags for compilation :-
    
    ● First Come First Serve = FCFS

    ● Priority Based = PBS
    
    ● Multilevel Feedback Queue = MLFQ
    
    Example :- make qemu SCHEDULER=MLFQ
